HI, IT'S MATTEO.

TO RUN THE APPLICATION, MAKE SURE TO PUT THE AUTHENTICATION USER AND PASSWORD AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND THEN THE APPLICATION WILL BE TAKING THEM. 
I'M ON MACOS SO FOR ME THE COMMAND TO DO SO IS "export AUTH_USERNAME=user" AND "export AUTH_PASSWORD=password" WITH OF COURSE YOUR CREDENTIAL.


- STUFF THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED:
    - MAYBE A LOGIN SERVICE THAT CAN BE REUSED IN DIFFERENT OCCASION SUCH AS NORMAL LOG IN WITH CREDENTIALS OR INDIRECT CREDENTIALS LIKE I ALREADY DO
    - THERE MAY BE SOME AUTOMATED TESTS...
    - SEE IF THE RESPONSE OBJECT CAN BE VIA REFLECTION CONVERTED IN A CSV ENTRY.
    - FIND A WAY TO MAYBE MAKE THE ANSWER BETTER IN VISUAL (OPTIONAL)
    - MAYBE IT CAN BE A POST CALL WITHOUT THE PARAMETERS EXPLICIT AND ALSO HAVING A MORE PRECISE NAME FOR CALL
