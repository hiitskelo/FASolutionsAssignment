HI, IT'S MATTEO.

TO RUN THE APPLICATION, MAKE SURE TO PUT THE AUTHENTICATION USER AND PASSWORD AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND THEN THE APPLICATION WILL BE TAKING THEM. 
I'M ON MACOS SO FOR ME THE COMMAND TO DO SO IS "export AUTH_USERNAME=user" AND "export AUTH_PASSWORD=password" WITH OF COURSE YOUR CREDENTIAL.
